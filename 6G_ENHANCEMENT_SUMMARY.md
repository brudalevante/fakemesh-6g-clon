# Fakemesh 6G Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This enhancement provides robust 6G band support for the fakemesh script, ensuring it works correctly with tri-band configurations (2G/5G/6G) while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. **Radio Detection Issues**
- **Problem**: Simple `grep .band=` pattern was fragile and didn't handle different system configurations
- **Solution**: Implemented robust `get_radio_for_band()` function with fallback logic that checks:
  - Direct UCI band configuration
  - Hardware mode detection (11g/11ng for 2G, 11a/11na for 5G, 11ax/11be for 6G)
  - Path-based detection for common radio naming patterns

### 2. **Controller Section Bug**
- **Problem**: Device assignment used undefined `${wifinet}` variable instead of `${radio}`
- **Solution**: Fixed to use `${radio}` variable properly throughout controller section

### 3. **Incomplete 6G Support**
- **Problem**: 6G was only partially supported in agent mode, missing from controller mode
- **Solution**: Added complete 6G support with meshx2 interface in both controller and agent modes

### 4. **Network Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: meshx2 interface was assigned to wrong network (meshx2 instead of meshx0)
- **Solution**: Fixed network assignment for proper bridging with other mesh interfaces

### 5. **6G Channel and Mode Configuration**
- **Problem**: No specific handling for 6G channel and EHT mode requirements
- **Solution**: Added automatic configuration of channel 37 and EHT40 mode for 6G radios

## Technical Changes

### New Radio Detection Function
```bash
get_radio_for_band() {
    local band="$1"
    local radio=""
    
    # First try: direct band match in UCI
    radio=$(uci show wireless 2>/dev/null | grep ".band='${band}'" | head -n1 | cut -d. -f2)
    
    # Fallback: hardware-based detection for common patterns
    # Handles phy0→2G, phy1→5G, phy2→6G mapping
}
```

### Enhanced Interface Creation
- **Controller Mode**: Creates meshx0, meshx1, meshx2 for 2G, 5G, 6G respectively
- **Agent Mode**: Creates meshx0 (AP), meshx1 (STA), meshx2 (6G AP) with proper network bridging
- **Consistent Configuration**: All interfaces use same encryption, rekey, and inactivity settings

### 6G Specific Optimizations
- Force channel 37 for 6G if in auto mode
- Automatically adjust EHT modes (EHT320/160/80 → EHT40) for better compatibility
- Proper SAE encryption for 6G security requirements

## Radio Mapping
The enhanced script correctly maps radios according to the board.json reference:
- **phy0/radio0** → 2G band → meshx0
- **phy1/radio1** → 5G band → meshx1  
- **phy2/radio2** → 6G band → meshx2

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing 2G/5G functionality preserved
- Existing configurations continue to work without changes
- New 6G support is automatically enabled when 6G radio is detected
- Graceful degradation when 6G radio is not available

## Testing Verification
All changes have been tested for:
- ✅ Script syntax validation
- ✅ Radio detection function correctness
- ✅ Multi-band support (2G/5G/6G)
- ✅ Interface consistency (meshx0/meshx1/meshx2)
- ✅ 6G specific configurations
- ✅ Controller/Agent mode compatibility

## Benefits
1. **Robust 6G Support**: Complete implementation matching 2G/5G quality
2. **Automatic Radio Selection**: Intelligent detection of appropriate radios for each band
3. **Future-Proof**: Handles various radio naming conventions and hardware configurations
4. **Seamless Operation**: Works with existing configurations while adding 6G capabilities
5. **Secure Configuration**: Proper SAE encryption and optimized EHT modes for 6G

The enhanced script is now ready for production use in tri-band mesh networks.
